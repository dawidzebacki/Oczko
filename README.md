Rules are very simple:

You can press HIT and take one more card.

You can press STAND and after other players turns check who is the most accurate.

If you would have more than 21 points you lost.

Exception is if you'll have two aces on the beginning. Then you win.

Points of card are numbers visible on the card or J:2, Q:3, K:4, A:11.

If you are playing single-player the dealer will HIT if his points is under 17 Otherwise the dealer will STAND.
